# Project description
This project is a streaming facility, that makes use of edge computing.
All the code must be written in Java or cxx11.

This streaming service is a mesh between Bittorrent and Netflix. The idea is to decentralized the
streaming service, so instead of only using the cloud servers, the clients must communicate between
them and share data blocks for a specific file.
